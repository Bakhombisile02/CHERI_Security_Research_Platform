## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### **Freestanding Implementation Focus**
This research platform exclusively uses **freestanding implementations** for precise security analysis:

1. **Pure Memory Operation Analysis**: Direct memory operations without library abstraction
2. **Consistent Cross-Architecture Comparison**: Identical operation sequences enable precise capability vs pointer analysis
3. **Hardware Protection Visibility**: Raw capability instructions show exact CHERI protection points
4. **Embedded/Bare-Metal Relevance**: Matches real-world CHERI deployment scenarios

### **Excluded: Standard Library Variants**
We deliberately **do not include** `*_stdlib.c` variants in this research because:
- **Library Abstraction**: Functions like `strcpy()`, `malloc()` mask the low-level memory operations we're analyzing
- **Inconsistent Protection**: Library implementations vary and may have their own security measures
- **Reduced Comparability**: Standard library calls obscure the fundamental differences between pointer and capability models
- **Hidden Complexity**: Library functions don't show the raw capability derivation and bounds checking we need to study

**Research Focus**: Direct memory manipulation demonstrating hardware-level protection differences.

## 🔧 Toolchain Configuration

### Standard RISC-V Environment
- **Compiler**: `riscv64-elf-gcc`
- **Target**: `rv64imac` (64-bit RISC-V with integer, multiplication, atomic, compressed)
- **Emulation**: QEMU system emulation
- **Focus**: Traditional pointer-based memory model

### Authentic CHERI Environment  
- **Compiler**: Real CHERI-LLVM (deployed at `/Users/dlaba556/cheri/output/sdk/bin/clang`)
- **Target**: `rv64imafdcxcheri` (RISC-V with CHERI capability extensions)
- **Emulation**: QEMU-CHERI with capability support
- **Focus**: 128-bit capability-based memory protection

## 🧪 Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Implementation Parity
Create identical security test scenarios for both architectures:
- Buffer overflow scenarios
- Use-after-free conditions
- Temporal safety violations
- Spatial memory errors
- Privilege escalation attempts

### Phase 2: Assembly Analysis
Generate and analyze assembly code for:
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Pointer arithmetic operations
- Function call mechanisms
- Memory access patterns
- Security boundary enforcement

### Phase 3: Extreme Detail Investigation

- **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Instruction-level breakdown of protection mechanisms  
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions, corner cases, and theoretical vulnerabilities
- **Assembly Walkthrough**: Complete instruction-by-instruction documentation
- **Capability Deep Dive**: CHERI capability structure and protection analysis

## 🔍 Key Analysis Points
