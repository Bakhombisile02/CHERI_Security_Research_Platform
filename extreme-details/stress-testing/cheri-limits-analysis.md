# CHERI Limits Analysis - Pushing CHERI to Failure Points

## Objectives
This document outlines comprehensive stress testing designed to find CHERI's breaking points and limitations, making the comparison with Standard RISC-V more fair and revealing areas where CHERI may fail or show significant overhead.

## CHERI Architectural Limits to Test

### 1. Capability Table Exhaustion
- **Limit**: CHERI systems have finite capability table entries
- **Test**: Exhaust available capability slots
- **Expected Failure**: System cannot allocate more capabilities

### 2. Capability Metadata Overhead
- **Limit**: 128-bit capabilities vs 64-bit pointers (2x memory)
- **Test**: Memory-intensive applications with capability pressure
- **Expected Failure**: Earlier memory exhaustion than Standard RISC-V

### 3. Performance Degradation Points
- **Limit**: Capability bounds checking overhead
- **Test**: High-frequency memory access patterns
- **Expected Failure**: Significant performance degradation vs Standard RISC-V

### 4. Complex Pointer Arithmetic Edge Cases
- **Limit**: Capability arithmetic complexity
- **Test**: Complex multi-level pointer manipulations
- **Expected Failure**: Cases where capability tracking becomes impractical

### 5. Inter-Process Communication Limits
- **Limit**: Capability transfer between processes
- **Test**: High-volume capability passing
- **Expected Failure**: IPC bottlenecks and overhead

4. **Operating System Kernel Operations**

## Expected CHERI Failure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Memory-Constrained Environments
- **Context**: Embedded systems with limited RAM
- **Failure**: 2x memory overhead makes CHERI impractical
- **Measurement**: Memory usage comparison at scale

### Scenario 2: High-Performance Computing
- **Context**: Tight computational loops with frequent memory access
- **Failure**: Capability bounds checking creates unacceptable latency
- **Measurement**: Performance degradation percentage

### Scenario 3: Legacy Code Integration
- **Context**: Existing codebases with complex pointer manipulation
- **Failure**: CHERI's restrictions break existing algorithms
- **Measurement**: Code compatibility and required modifications

### Scenario 4: Real-Time Systems
- **Context**: Hard real-time constraints
- **Failure**: Non-deterministic capability overhead breaks timing
- **Measurement**: Timing predictability and worst-case execution time

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Limit Testing
- Implement capability table exhaustion tests
- Create memory pressure scenarios
- Measure baseline performance overhead

### Phase 2: Realistic Application Stress
- Port real applications to both architectures
- Measure practical performance differences
- Identify breaking points in real workloads

### Phase 3: Edge Case Discovery
- Create pathological test cases
- Find scenarios where CHERI provides no benefit
- Document cases where Standard RISC-V is superior

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Analysis
- Compare total cost of ownership
- Analyze deployment feasibility
- Create fair comparison metrics

## Fairness Improvements

### Current Bias Toward CHERI
1. **Artificial Test Cases**: Current tests favor CHERI's strengths
2. **Simulated Implementation**: Not testing real CHERI overhead
3. **Limited Scope**: Not testing CHERI's weaknesses
4. **Academic Focus**: Not testing practical deployment challenges

### Proposed Balanced Testing
1. **Real-World Workloads**: Test actual applications, not toy examples
2. **Performance-Critical Scenarios**: Test where overhead matters most
3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Test where CHERI overhead is prohibitive
4. **Legacy Compatibility**: Test integration challenges

## Success Metrics for Fair Comparison

### CHERI Advantages (Expected)
- Memory safety violation prevention: 100%
- Security exploit mitigation: Near 100%
- Automatic protection: No code changes required

### CHERI Disadvantages (To Be Measured)
- Memory overhead: 2x baseline
- Performance overhead: TBD (current estimate 33%)
- Hardware complexity: Additional silicon required
- Software ecosystem: Requires recompilation

### Standard RISC-V Advantages (To Be Highlighted)
- Memory efficiency: Baseline
- Performance: Baseline speed
- Hardware simplicity: Existing implementations
- Software compatibility: Existing ecosystem

### Standard RISC-V Disadvantages (Current Focus)
- Memory safety: No protection
- Security vulnerabilities: High exposure
- Manual protection: Requires careful coding

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Stress Test Suite**: Create the tests outlined above
2. **Real CHERI Testing**: If possible, test on actual CHERI hardware
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Add comprehensive performance measurement
4. **Application Porting**: Port real applications to both architectures
5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Create realistic deployment scenarios

This analysis will provide a much more balanced and fair comparison between CHERI and Standard RISC-V architectures.
