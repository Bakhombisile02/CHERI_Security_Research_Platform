# The CHERI Security Research Platform Journey

> **A Complete Documentation of Our Path from Concept to Comprehensive Platform**

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document chronicles the complete journey of implementing a comprehensive CHERI security research platform, from initial concept to a fully-featured dual-environment analysis system. We transformed theoretical security concepts into practical, measurable implementations that compare Standard RISC-V against Authentic CHERI memory protection mechanisms.

## üìÖ **Project Timeline & Evolution**

### **Phase 1: Initial Standard RISC-V Implementation (Masters Project)**
**Goal**: Create theoretical CHERI analysis using standard RISC-V toolchain
**Duration**: First implementation cycle
**Key Achievement**: Established baseline for memory vulnerability analysis

### **Phase 2: Dual CHERI Environment Development**
**Goal**: Implement both educational mock and authentic CHERI environments
**Duration**: Second development cycle  
**Key Achievement**: Real CHERI-LLVM toolchain deployment

### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Platform Integration**
**Goal**: Combine both projects into unified research platform with extreme technical details
**Duration**: Current phase
**Key Achievement**: Complete comparative analysis framework

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Methodology**

### **Approach 1: Iterative Development**
- Started with basic concept validation
- Gradually added complexity and depth
- Maintained working state at each iteration
- Built comprehensive testing at each level

### **Approach 2: Multiple Environment Strategy**
- **Standard RISC-V**: Baseline vulnerability demonstration
- **Mock CHERI**: Educational capability simulation  
- **Authentic CHERI**: Production-ready hardware protection

### **Approach 3: Extreme Technical Detail Focus**
- Raw compilation logs and outputs
- Step-by-step assembly analysis
- Edge case boundary testing
- Complete capability mechanism documentation

## üéØ **Key Challenges Faced & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: CHERI Toolchain Compilation**
**Problem**: Native LLVM build required 2945 targets, 30+ minutes compilation time
**Impact**: Significant development time overhead, 10GB+ disk space requirement
**Solution**: 
- Automated build process with progress monitoring
- Background compilation while developing other components
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures

**Code Evidence**:
```bash
# From our setup scripts
echo "Building LLVM native (2945 targets, ~30 minutes)..."
cd "$CHERI_BUILD_DIR" && ./cheribuild.py llvm-native
```

### **Challenge 2: Mock vs Authentic Environment Balance**
**Problem**: Balancing educational simplicity with technical accuracy
**Impact**: Risk of oversimplified mock environment losing educational value
**Solution**:
- Dual-environment architecture preserving both approaches
- Clear documentation of differences and appropriate use cases
- Side-by-side comparison capabilities

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Dual compilation support
./scripts/compile_cheri_scenarios.sh --mock      # Educational
./scripts/compile_cheri_scenarios.sh --full-cheri # Production
```

### **Challenge 3: Assembly Analysis Complexity**
**Problem**: CHERI assembly significantly more complex than standard RISC-V
**Impact**: Difficulty in creating comprehensive step-by-step analysis
**Solution**:
- Instruction-by-instruction breakdown methodology
- Memory layout visualization
- Security implication documentation for each instruction

**Example Output**:
```assembly
# Standard RISC-V (vulnerable)
addi    sp, sp, -32          # No bounds checking
sd      ra, 24(sp)           # 64-bit pointer store

# Authentic CHERI (protected)
cincoffset  csp, csp, -64    # Capability-preserving stack adjustment
csc         cra, 48(csp)     # 128-bit capability store with bounds
```

### **Challenge 4: Edge Case Test Implementation**
**Problem**: Creating realistic edge cases that demonstrate actual protection mechanisms
**Impact**: Without real edge cases, theoretical protection claims lack validation
**Solution**:
- Comprehensive boundary condition testing
- Off-by-one error implementations
- Negative index access scenarios
- Zero-length buffer edge cases

**Test Examples**:
```c
// Off-by-one test that exposes protection differences
void off_by_one_test() {
    char buffer[10];
    for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {  // Intentional bug
        buffer[i] = 'A';  // Standard: corrupts memory, CHERI: hardware exception
    }
}
```

### **Challenge 5: Raw Output Collection System**
**Problem**: Capturing all compilation and execution logs for analysis
**Impact**: Without raw data, deep technical analysis impossible
**Solution**:
- Automated logging with verbose compiler output
- Structured log organization by architecture and scenario
- Capability-specific trace collection

**Log Structure**:
```
raw-outputs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standard-riscv/compilation-logs/buffer_overflow_gcc_verbose.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authentic-cheri/capability-analysis/buffer_overflow_capability_trace.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ comparison-logs/side-by-side-compilation.log
```

### **Challenge 6: Platform Integration Complexity**
**Problem**: Combining multiple projects with different structures and toolchains
**Impact**: Risk of losing functionality or creating inconsistencies
**Solution**:
- Unified Makefile system
- Standardized directory structure
- Comprehensive automation scripts
- Consistent naming conventions

### **Challenge 7: GCC Debug File Management**
**Problem**: GCC debug compilation generated 424+ intermediate files (50-100MB) from `-fdump-tree-all` and `-fdump-rtl-all` flags
**Impact**: 
- Workspace cluttered with thousands of debug files
- Significant disk space usage for research analysis
- Confusion between source files and compiler intermediates
**Solution**:
- Documented debug file generation for compiler analysis research
- Implemented selective debug output for specific analysis needs
- Created cleanup procedures to maintain workspace organization

**Debug File Examples**:
```
buffer_overflow_debug-buffer_overflow.c.006t.original
buffer_overflow_debug-buffer_overflow.c.007t.gimple
buffer_overflow_debug-buffer_overflow.c.361r.final
...424 total intermediate compilation files
```

**Resolution**: Removed debug files after documenting their purpose, maintaining clean workspace while preserving capability for future detailed compiler analysis when needed.

### **Challenge 8: Standard Library vs Freestanding Implementation Strategy**
**Problem**: Conflicting approaches between standard library and freestanding implementations for CHERI research
**Impact**: 
- Inconsistent vulnerability demonstrations across environments
- Standard library masking low-level memory operations
- Reduced portability to embedded/bare-metal CHERI systems
**Solution**:
- Standardized on freestanding implementations for consistent analysis
- Documented decision to exclude stdlib variants from research platform
- Focused on pure CHERI capability mechanisms without library interference

**Technical Rationale**:
```c
// Stdlib version (hidden complexity)
strcpy(dest, src);  // Library function obscures memory operations

// Freestanding version (explicit CHERI operations)
while (*src) {
    *dest++ = *src++;  // Direct capability bounds checking visible
}
```

**Resolution**: Removed stdlib variants, standardized on freestanding implementations that clearly demonstrate CHERI capability protection mechanisms without library abstraction.

## üìä **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### **Decision 1: Workspace Structure**
**Choice**: Hierarchical organization with clear separation
**Rationale**: Enables independent development while supporting integration
**Impact**: Clean organization supporting both individual and comparative analysis

```
CHERI_Security_Research_Platform/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comparative-analysis/     # Integration point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extreme-details/         # Deep technical analysis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/                # Unified output collection
```

### **Decision 2: Build System Design**
**Choice**: Comprehensive Makefile with multiple targets
**Rationale**: Single command to build and analyze everything
**Impact**: Simplified workflow, consistent results

```makefile
all: standard-riscv authentic-cheri analysis
standard-riscv: $(STANDARD_OBJECTS)
authentic-cheri: $(CHERI_OBJECTS) 
analysis: comparative-analysis/comprehensive_analysis.sh
```

### **Decision 3: Analysis Methodology**
**Choice**: Three-tier analysis (Standard ‚Üí Mock ‚Üí Real CHERI)
**Rationale**: Progressive complexity allows understanding at each level
**Impact**: Educational value combined with production relevance

### **Decision 4: Documentation Strategy**
