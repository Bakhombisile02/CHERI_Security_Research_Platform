## Key Findings

### CHERI Advantages
- Hardware-enforced spatial memory safety
- Temporal safety through capability tag invalidation
- Unforgeable capability-based protection
- Comprehensive protection against memory corruption

### CHERI Trade-offs
- Increased binary size due to capability metadata
- Runtime overhead from capability validation
- Memory overhead from capability storage
- Complexity in low-level system programming

### Performance Impact Areas
1. **Memory Access Patterns**: Every memory access validated
2. **Function Calls**: Capability parameters checked
3. **Data Structures**: Each pointer dereference validated
4. **System Calls**: Capability-aware interface overhead

## Scenarios Where CHERI Shows Overhead

### 1. High-Frequency Memory Access
Performance-critical code with tight loops and frequent memory access shows measurable CHERI overhead due to capability validation.

### 2. Pointer-Intensive Data Structures
Complex data structures with many pointers (linked lists, trees) show overhead from capability validation on traversal.

### 3. Memory-Constrained Systems
CHERI's capability overhead (typically 100% memory overhead for pointers) can be significant in memory-limited environments.

### 4. Real-Time Systems
Capability validation introduces deterministic but measurable latency that may affect real-time guarantees.

## Fair Assessment Conclusion

CHERI provides unprecedented memory safety at the cost of:
- **Space**: ~100% overhead for pointer storage
- **Time**: Measurable capability validation overhead
- **Complexity**: More complex programming model

The trade-off is between **perfect memory safety** and **traditional performance optimization**.

## Recommendations

### When CHERI is Ideal
- Security-critical applications
- Systems where memory safety bugs are costly
- Applications where the performance trade-off is acceptable

### When Standard RISC-V May Be Preferred
- Extreme performance-critical systems
- Memory-constrained embedded systems
- Legacy code with extensive pointer manipulation

### Hybrid Approaches
- Use CHERI for security-critical components
- Standard RISC-V for performance-critical sections
- Gradual migration strategies
