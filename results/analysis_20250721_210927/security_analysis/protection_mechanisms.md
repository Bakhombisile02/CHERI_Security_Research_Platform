## buffer_overflow Security Analysis

### Standard RISC-V Vulnerability Analysis
**Potential Vulnerability Indicators:**
- Unchecked memory loads: 33
- Unchecked memory stores: 28
- Stack operations without bounds checking: 42
- Potential pointer arithmetic operations: 28

### Authentic CHERI Protection Analysis
**CHERI Protection Mechanisms:**
- Capability loads (bounds-checked): 35
- Capability stores (bounds-checked): 31
- Bounds setting operations: 2
- Offset operations (bounds-preserving): 32
- Total protected memory operations: 66
- **Protection Coverage: 100% (all memory operations bounds-checked)**

### Protection Comparison

| Metric | Standard RISC-V | Authentic CHERI |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Total Memory Operations | 61 | 66 |
| Bounds Checking | 0% | 100% |
| Spatial Safety | Software Only | Hardware Enforced |
| Temporal Safety | None | Capability Invalidation |
